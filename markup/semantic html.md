**12 tips for creating semantic HTML**

There are many ways to mark up the content with HTML elements, but some are better than others - we call them semantic.

Writing semantic HTML means using HTML elements to structure your content based on each element's meaning, not its appearance.

Websites built following the principles of semantic HTML:
1. they are easier to edit and maintain later,
2. are easier to parse by screen readers (accessibility),
3. they probably rank better in search engines.

The principles of semantic HTML are well explained in the HTML5 Cookbook by Christopher Schmitt and Kyle Simpson (O'Reilly). Chapter 1: Fundamental Syntax and Semantics is available for free on the publisher's website.
