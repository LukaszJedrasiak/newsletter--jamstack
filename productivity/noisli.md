If you have difficulty concentrating while working, try Noisli - an application that plays non-distracting background sounds: forest noise, birds singing, falling rain, etc.

You can combine individual tracks - choose from 16 soundtracks available in the free version and an additional 12 in the pro version.

The app also has a built-in timer that turns off the sound after a set time â€“ a useful function when working with the time blocks method (e.g. Pomodoro technique).
