If you have trouble staying focused at work and are constantly distracted, break your day into smaller blocks â€“ preferably 25 minutes each.

Set the timer for 25 minutes, put on headphones, turn on non-distracting sounds (e.g. singing birds or the sound of rain) and focus on only one task.

After each block, take a short break (typically 5-10 minutes). After the fourth finished block, take an extended break (20-30 minutes),

You have to start over if you break your block in the middle of it.

Therefore, an essential element of this technique is noting each completed block on a paper. 

During the first days, I managed to close 2-3 blocks at most, but after a week of training, I can complete as many as 6 intervals during the day.

The effect - I finally finished the website prototype that has been following me since the summer holidays.
