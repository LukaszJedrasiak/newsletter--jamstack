If you have trouble staying focused at work and are constantly distracted, break your day into smaller blocks. These blocks are known as _pomodoros_, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer, which the creator of this technique used.

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the timer for 25 minutes.
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5–10 minutes).
5. If you have finished fewer than three blocks, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three intervals.
6. After three blocks are done, take the fourth and then take an extended break (typically 20 to 30 minutes). Once you finish the long break, return to step 2.

You have to start over if you break your block in the middle of it. Therefore, an essential element of this technique is noting each completed block on a paper. During the first days, I managed to close 2-3 blocks at most, but after a week of training, I can complete as many as 12 intervals during the day.

The effect - I finally finished the website prototype that has been following me since the summer holidays.
