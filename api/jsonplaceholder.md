{JSON} Placeholder is another noteworthy free REST API filled with fake data – an excellent tool to test the fetch() command while learning JavaScript.

The API supports all HTTP requests: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.

There are three versions of the tool:
1. JSON Placeholder – live running version with fake data added by the creators of the tool,
2. My JSON Server – a simple server that downloads your data from a combined repository on GitHub,
3. JSON Server - software with all functions to share your data in JSON format. You can deploy it on Heroku, for example.
