Ten reasons to build your next web project with Hugo static site generator.

1. Hugo is fast - rebuilding even a large website takes a few (milli)seconds.
2. Hugo is stable - it attempts to be backwards-compatible across releases.
3. Hugo is performance-driven - even if you write terrible code, the core performance of the built-in functions ensures relatively good performance for the website's compilation.
4. Hugo is self-contained - no more installing hundreds of plugins that developers no longer support over time. Instead, you add new features in Hugo using code snippets written in the Go template language.
5. Hugo is a single file - its creators packed all core dependencies and resources into a single executable file. No more dependencies to update and no build systems to manage.
6. Hugo needs no maintenance - no dependencies means no maintenance. You can get a compelling website with just Hugo and a hosting provider.
7. Hugo is opinionated - it has generic implementations for pagination, categorizing content into unlimited types of categories, multilingual content, and getting core website elements like menus.
8. Hugo is powerful - go template language and support for interacting with APIs and JavaScript make it possible to build any website with Hugo: from a personal portfolio, through a corporate website, to an online store.
9. Hugo is scalable - Hugo has a proven record of handling the scale of some of the big and heavily used websites on the internet (Let's Encrypt, KeyCDN, 1Password Support).
10. Hugo is open source - it cannot pivot, get acquired, or shut down at the whim of a corporation.
