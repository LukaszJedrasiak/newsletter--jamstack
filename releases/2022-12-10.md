**Jamstack newsletter issue #002 | What is a static site generator**

I finally started rebuilding my personal website. The existing one is built on Wordpress. I create a new one from scratch in accordance with the jamstack approach, i.e. using HTML, CSS and JS. I use the Hugo static site generator (SSG).

In this newsletter issue you will learn what SSG is, how to create a drop-down menu in Figma and how to code this menu only with CSS, without using javascript.
