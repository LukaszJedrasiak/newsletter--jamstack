**Jamstack newsletter issue #001 | Obsidian - a new way to take notes while learning to code.**

My most significant discovery last week was Obsidian - a program for creating and organizing notes. Its most important advantage over the traditional linear way of taking notes is the ability to freely connect individual notes - similar to how the human brain works. Thank you, @Daniel, for the recommendation.

P.S. I've changed the name and description of my weekly newsletter to reflect better the topics discussed here. I will focus primarily on front-end web development with the jamstack approach. However, digital marketers will also find helpful information here, mainly in the context of SEO. Enjoy reading!
