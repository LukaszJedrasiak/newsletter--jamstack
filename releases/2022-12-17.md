**Jamstack newsletter issue # 003 | Why choose Hugo static site generator**

In the previous issue of the newsletter, I recommended an article about what static page generators are. In this issue, I explain why I chose Hugo.

From the remaining points, you will learn the following:
- how to implement a dark mode switcher on a website,
- how to fill your website with fake data from free API,
- about twelve rules of the semantic HTML,
- what is atomic design and how to use it during web development,
- about the app playing non-distracting background sounds.

If you're interested in learning to program or making a career switch to front-end web development, you'll want to check out this newsletter! It's a valuable resource filled with my notes and insights as I navigate this journey.

Plus, I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences in the comments – sharing knowledge and supporting each other is a crucial part of the learning process. So don't miss out – check out this newsletter and join the conversation!
